/**
 * iCalendar Location class - This object represents a URL and corresponds to
 * the URL iCalendar property. <br/> From the RFC: <br/> <quote>
 * Purpose: The property defines the intended venue for the activity
 * defined by a calendar component.
 * <br/>
 * Value Type: TEXT
 * <br/>
 * Property Parameters: Non-standard, alternate text representation and
 * language property parameters can be specified on this property.

 * pointing to a MIME body part containing a vCard [RFC 2426] for the
 * location.
